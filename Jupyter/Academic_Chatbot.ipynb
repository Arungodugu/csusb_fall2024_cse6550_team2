With no standardized tests being utilized by the CSU for admission, students now have the opportunity to have other assets and attributes considered in the admission process including but not limited to, participation in programs or clubs available at your school or in the community\\xa0(AVID, Future Leaders, etc.) This is also a critical time to begin saving for college expenses and learning about Financial Aid and Scholarships. Take the opportunity to do your best in the Early Assessment Program (part of the CAASPP/Smarter Balanced Assessment) in the 11th grade.

The \"value added\" by a CSUSB education ranks in the top 4 percent in the nation, according to the Collegiate Learning Assessment, a sequence of tests used by hundreds of colleges and universities nationwide that measure student learning in the freshman and then in the senior year. First-to-second year retention rates are third highest among all CSU campuses. CSUSB reflects the dynamic diversity of the region and has the most diverse student population of any university in the Inland Empire, and it has the second highest African American and Hispanic enrollments of all public universities in California. Seventy percent of those who graduate are the first in their families to do so. The university offers more than 70 traditional baccalaureate and master\\'s degree programs, education credential and certificate programs, and a doctoral program. In recent years, CSUSB added its first doctorate (educational leadership), engineering program (computer science and engineering) and M.F.A. programs in creative writing and studio art/design. Every CSUSB academic program that is eligible has earned national accreditation. The university also is home to the California Professor of the Year (Stuart Sumida). \\xa0 Cal State San Bernardino has seen records in enrollment, diversity of faculty and students, grant and contract funding, overhead funds, fundraising and international programs development. CSUSB ranks as the second-safest among all 33 public universities in California.

The award is given annually to nursing programs that demonstrate excellence in student learning outcomes and program effectiveness, recognizing institutions that use data-driven insights to continually improve nursing education and elevate student success. “It\\'s important for us to find these stories that sometimes make us uncomfortable to be able to see, what can we learn from that today? What can we fix? Because those things are still in our power. Even if this is something that has happened in the past,” said Alicia Gutierrez-Romine ’10, CSUSB professor and renowned expert on the history of abortion in the United States.

I could not be more proud of each and every one of you and the impact you have had and continue to have in transforming the lives of our students, their families and their communities throughout the Inland Empire. Every academic department, student club, musical or theatrical performance, and athletic team contributes in some way to the well-being of the region we serve. This is the very definition of an anchor institution. We are all together here in a very, very special place. We have a vital mission here. And we punch well above our weight. Each one of you is making a real difference. I am delighted to see so many here today as we begin the 2024-25 academic year at Cal State San Bernardino. I would especially like to welcome the many new faces joining our campus, in particular the additions to our faculty, staff and administration. Each of you brings an impressive array of knowledge and experience to our vibrant community. I am glad you are here at CSUSB. I would like to add that I am very proud to welcome 20 new faculty! And welcome to our visiting faculty member—we’re glad you are here! Also, between July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024, we had 283 new employee hires and promotions. We are delighted to have you all as members of CSUSB! We also welcome our undergraduate and graduate students. They range from newcomers getting their initial taste of Coyote life to those entering their final months as they work toward their CSUSB graduation. I would like to begin today by sharing some highlights from our 2023-24 achievements, through the lens of our university’s strategic plan. For Goal 1 – Student Success: For Goal 2 – Faculty and Staff Success: For Goal 3 – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: For Goal 4 – Internationalization: As we think about 2024-25, whose launch we are recognizing today, I now want to take a deep dive into the areas of DEI, civic engagement, enrollment management and student success. They are all deeply woven together and their success, our success, our students’ success, needs to take all these areas into consideration. First, know that, regardless of voices telling us that our nation’s diversity is divisive or a distraction, we are continuing to double down on our DEI focus and efforts here at Cal State San Bernardino. Because, as reporting from the movement advancement project states, “at least 42 states have introduced over 440 bills attacking DEI in a variety of ways, and over half (23) of those states have enacted at least one such law or policy over that time frame.” We are incredibly fortunate to live in a state which is also doubling down on the understanding that our diversity is our strength. In addition, I am thankful we live in a state which values the histories of all Americans and is not afraid to share them, regardless of their darker and painful aspects. Therefore, in this past year we have created the Office of Tribal Relations and the Office of Black Student Success. Because we want to ensure that these members of our student body feel at home and included on our campus.\\xa0 Both offices will be growing their services and offerings in the coming year. We have also just received some terrific news: Excelencia in Education, which is “committed to Ensuring America’s Future by increasing Latino college completion,” has announced that CSUSB’s Upward Bound program is one of 18 finalists in their “2024 Examples of\\xa0Excelencia.” In addition, our “Dream Internship” has made their “Programs to Watch” list! Another key long-term trait and focus of CSUSB is its focus on community and civic engagement. A university has never been, and can never be, treated as some type of ivory tower, divorced from the community in which it sits.\\xa0At CSUSB, we recognize that we are an anchor institution. I say this a lot, to the point where the phrase may begin to sound like it is just words.\\xa0But it is not just words. It is actions. What this means, as a higher education community here in the Inland Empire, in our collective lives as CSUSB and in our personal lives, we support our communities through engagement and involvement. We volunteer. We learn about local issues affecting our city councils and our school boards. And we exercise the franchise, that is, the right we possess as American citizens to vote. Because not only does each vote count (we can see this in local races which can literally be decided by votes that can be counted on the fingers of both hands), but our votes ARE our voices in a democracy. We cannot take anything for granted. We are the ones who build our futures through this valuable tool. We see this on campus as well, with our student elected government, our faculty elected body, and our staff elected body. The next key issue I wish to touch on is enrollment. To be frank, we’re not a university without a student body.\\xa0While we’re not alone in struggling to regain enrollment as a result of the pandemic’s impacts, that doesn’t mean we ignore the current moment. For example, we know we will likely see increased competition for our students from other universities throughout our state. In addition, Institutional Research has recently identified a worrying trend: we are losing more students than we are admitting. For example, in 2023-24, we admitted 4,832 students while 6,123 students either graduated or unfortunately left without earning a degree.\\xa0This means, on average, we admitted 0.8 students for every student who stopped-out or graduated. Everybody has a role—a leadership role—to play in ensuring that students leave here with a degree. That includes encouraging students to attend and then supporting students throughout their academic path so that they persist.\\xa0 So, this is an all hands on deck moment for the entire campus. And I would argue that our alumni also have a role to play as well. Therefore, I would like to briefly recognize our incoming inaugural vice president of the new division of Strategic Enrollment Management and Marketing, Dr. David Dufault-Hunter. He will be joining us at CSUSB on September 3rd from Cal State Northridge. David, we look forward to welcoming you soon! With an increased focus on communications and getting the word out to potential students in our region—about who we are, what we can offer, and how we can help them to realize their academic goals—we can begin to tackle more aggressively both recruitment issues and the loss versus admittance issues we have been facing.\\xa0We must grow enrollment by admitting more students and retaining more students. All of this comes together with our goal to support and promote student success here at CSUSB. We need to look at student success through the lens of an engaged campus. If we want engaged students—we know that engagement promotes persistence and eventual graduation—then we need an engaged campus. And an engaged campus means engaged faculty, staff and administrators. And that is what we are doing at CSUSB. Being physically present, with our students, is key to serving them, and face-to-face interaction is also important for staff interaction. So, effective fall 2024, CSUSB will be moving to a one-day-per-week telecommuting opportunity, maximum, for those whose roles allow remote work. Let 2024-25 be the year of re-engagement with our students so that we can build student success!\\xa0This must be the focus of all who work on this campus, regardless of what position you hold or what area of responsibility you cover. Let’s build one-on-one relationships with our students. Let’s celebrate the way our faculty engage with our students outside the classroom through research projects or through mentoring, student clubs or organizations. Let’s ask ourselves, what are other ways that our college offices and our administrative offices and their employees can engage with our students, including with their clubs and organizations? We cannot remain at a 1,000-foot level. Students are people, not widgets or statistics.\\xa0 Even if your responsibilities do not involve a face-to-face daily interactive role, you are still here to build student success. Again, realizing the potential of our students and realizing the potential of CSUSB are both so tightly woven together that you cannot truly separate one from the other. Therefore, in 2024-25', 'source': 'https://www.csusb.edu/cse'}, {'page_content': 'let us reconnect with this understanding:\\xa0 Let this be the Year of Engagement! I want to conclude today by reminding us all of what it means to be a citizen of Cal State San Bernardino. Regardless of our efforts on campus to be more intentional in diversity, equity and inclusion, the world outside our doors continues to move in ways which do not necessarily accord with our university’s inclusive values. Nevertheless, as members of the CSUSB community, we state that: As we begin 2024-25, we do not forget that, together, we must continue to strive to be an inclusive community of diverse students and scholars, committed to the positive impact higher education affords our region. Each of us can make a difference. It is fundamental to all we do and desire to achieve here at CSUSB. And now, I am happy to continue a CSUSB tradition and leave you with a video highlighting some of the successes and inspirational achievements of the last year. And don’t forget! Homecoming is right around the corner: Saturday – October 26th!

The steering committee reached a consensus and recommended that the\\xa0Association of Governing Boards (AGB)\\xa0and\\xa0Dr. James Lyons\\xa0be selected to serve CSUSB in this capacity. (Links: https://agb.org/, https://agb.org/james-e-lyons-sr/) The desired goal of the Shared Governance Steering Committee is to work collaboratively with campus stakeholders to develop a statement on shared governance to guide CSUSB forward. Dr. Lyons began his work with CSUSB in Spring 2019, meeting with the various governance groups and to get their impressions of shared governance on campus. Dr. Lyons’ next campus visit will be on October 14 – 15, which will focus on obtaining stakeholder thoughts and guidance on what should be included in the CSUSB Statement on Shared Governance. Dr. Lyons has confirmed a time to meet with each governance group with additional campus forums available. The schedule may be found below. Dr. Lyons will continue his work with CSUSB into Winter Quarter 2020, with the goal of sharing the finalized statement on shared governance at that time. Shared governance is the process by which various constituents (traditionally governing boards, senior administration, and faculty; possibly also staff, students, or others) contribute to decision making related to college or university policy and procedure. When done well, shared governance strengthens the quality of leadership and decision-making at an institution, enhances its ability to achieve its vision and to meet strategic goals, and increases the odds that the very best thinking by all parties to shared governance is brought to bear on institutional challenges. When done well, shared governance engenders an institutional culture of collective ownership and accountability for the institution’s present and future. Further, when faculty, administrators, and boards are actively and collaboratively involved in decision-making processes, decisions are implemented more quickly and more effectively.

It also does not mean that decision-making is always the result of a vote. Importantly, shared governance aims to ensure that no one person is arbitrarily making important decisions absent the input and feedback from key constituents. Source: SDSU Open Conversation about Shared Governance (Links: /sites/default/files/SharedGovernanceDocument_SDSU_Feb2019.pdf) Studies of shared leadership have identified many positive outcomes for teams and organizations that adopt this approach. These include improvements in attitudes and cognition, such as increased satisfaction and trust among team members; improved behavior, such as more constructive interaction and social integration; and improved effectiveness, including in task performance and student learning. New research shows great promise in the use of shared leadership on college campuses. Findings show that shared leadership can create greater cognitive complexity, innovation and peer support in times of challenge and crisis. It can increase accountability within organizations and improve the implementation of organizational decisions.

I could not be more proud of each and every one of you and the impact you have had and continue to have in transforming the lives of our students, their families and their communities throughout the Inland Empire. Every academic department, student club, musical or theatrical performance, and athletic team contributes in some way to the well-being of the region we serve. This is the very definition of an anchor institution. We are all together here in a very, very special place. We have a vital mission here. And we punch well above our weight. Each one of you is making a real difference. I am delighted to see so many here today as we begin the 2024-25 academic year at Cal State San Bernardino. I would especially like to welcome the many new faces joining our campus, in particular the additions to our faculty, staff and administration. Each of you brings an impressive array of knowledge and experience to our vibrant community. I am glad you are here at CSUSB. I would like to add that I am very proud to welcome 20 new faculty! And welcome to our visiting faculty member—we’re glad you are here! Also, between July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024, we had 283 new employee hires and promotions. We are delighted to have you all as members of CSUSB! We also welcome our undergraduate and graduate students. They range from newcomers getting their initial taste of Coyote life to those entering their final months as they work toward their CSUSB graduation. I would like to begin today by sharing some highlights from our 2023-24 achievements, through the lens of our university’s strategic plan. For Goal 1 – Student Success: For Goal 2 – Faculty and Staff Success: For Goal 3 – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: For Goal 4 – Internationalization: As we think about 2024-25, whose launch we are recognizing today, I now want to take a deep dive into the areas of DEI, civic engagement, enrollment management and student success. They are all deeply woven together and their success, our success, our students’ success, needs to take all these areas into consideration. First, know that, regardless of voices telling us that our nation’s diversity is divisive or a distraction, we are continuing to double down on our DEI focus and efforts here at Cal State San Bernardino. Because, as reporting from the movement advancement project states, “at least 42 states have introduced over 440 bills attacking DEI in a variety of ways, and over half (23) of those states have enacted at least one such law or policy over that time frame.” We are incredibly fortunate to live in a state which is also doubling down on the understanding that our diversity is our strength. In addition, I am thankful we live in a state which values the histories of all Americans and is not afraid to share them, regardless of their darker and painful aspects. Therefore, in this past year we have created the Office of Tribal Relations and the Office of Black Student Success. Because we want to ensure that these members of our student body feel at home and included on our campus.\\xa0 Both offices will be growing their services and offerings in the coming year. We have also just received some terrific news: Excelencia in Education, which is “committed to Ensuring America’s Future by increasing Latino college completion,” has announced that CSUSB’s Upward Bound program is one of 18 finalists in their “2024 Examples of\\xa0Excelencia.” In addition, our “Dream Internship” has made their “Programs to Watch” list! Another key long-term trait and focus of CSUSB is its focus on community and civic engagement. A university has never been, and can never be, treated as some type of ivory tower, divorced from the community in which it sits.\\xa0At CSUSB, we recognize that we are an anchor institution. I say this a lot, to the point where the phrase may begin to sound like it is just words.\\xa0But it is not just words. It is actions. What this means, as a higher education community here in the Inland Empire, in our collective lives as CSUSB and in our personal lives, we support our communities through engagement and involvement. We volunteer. We learn about local issues affecting our city councils and our school boards. And we exercise the franchise, that is, the right we possess as American citizens to vote. Because not only does each vote count (we can see this in local races which can literally be decided by votes that can be counted on the fingers of both hands), but our votes ARE our voices in a democracy. We cannot take anything for granted. We are the ones who build our futures through this valuable tool. We see this on campus as well, with our student elected government, our faculty elected body, and our staff elected body. The next key issue I wish to touch on is enrollment. To be frank, we’re not a university without a student body.\\xa0While we’re not alone in struggling to regain enrollment as a result of the pandemic’s impacts, that doesn’t mean we ignore the current moment. For example, we know we will likely see increased competition for our students from other universities throughout our state. In addition, Institutional Research has recently identified a worrying trend: we are losing more students than we are admitting. For example, in 2023-24, we admitted 4,832 students while 6,123 students either graduated or unfortunately left without earning a degree.\\xa0This means, on average, we admitted 0.8 students for every student who stopped-out or graduated. Everybody has a role—a leadership role—to play in ensuring that students leave here with a degree. That includes encouraging students to attend and then supporting students throughout their academic path so that they persist.\\xa0 So, this is an all hands on deck moment for the entire campus. And I would argue that our alumni also have a role to play as well. Therefore, I would like to briefly recognize our incoming inaugural vice president of the new division of Strategic Enrollment Management and Marketing, Dr. David Dufault-Hunter. He will be joining us at CSUSB on September 3rd from Cal State Northridge. David, we look forward to welcoming you soon! With an increased focus on communications and getting the word out to potential students in our region—about who we are, what we can offer, and how we can help them to realize their academic goals—we can begin to tackle more aggressively both recruitment issues and the loss versus admittance issues we have been facing.\\xa0We must grow enrollment by admitting more students and retaining more students. All of this comes together with our goal to support and promote student success here at CSUSB. We need to look at student success through the lens of an engaged campus. If we want engaged students—we know that engagement promotes persistence and eventual graduation—then we need an engaged campus. And an engaged campus means engaged faculty, staff and administrators. And that is what we are doing at CSUSB. Being physically present, with our students, is key to serving them, and face-to-face interaction is also important for staff interaction. So, effective fall 2024', 'source': 'https://www.csusb.edu/cse'}, {'page_content': 'CSUSB will be moving to a one-day-per-week telecommuting opportunity, maximum, for those whose roles allow remote work. Let 2024-25 be the year of re-engagement with our students so that we can build student success!\\xa0This must be the focus of all who work on this campus, regardless of what position you hold or what area of responsibility you cover. Let’s build one-on-one relationships with our students. Let’s celebrate the way our faculty engage with our students outside the classroom through research projects or through mentoring, student clubs or organizations. Let’s ask ourselves, what are other ways that our college offices and our administrative offices and their employees can engage with our students, including with their clubs and organizations? We cannot remain at a 1,000-foot level. Students are people, not widgets or statistics.\\xa0 Even if your responsibilities do not involve a face-to-face daily interactive role, you are still here to build student success. Again, realizing the potential of our students and realizing the potential of CSUSB are both so tightly woven together that you cannot truly separate one from the other. Therefore, in 2024-25, let us reconnect with this understanding:\\xa0 Let this be the Year of Engagement! I want to conclude today by reminding us all of what it means to be a citizen of Cal State San Bernardino. Regardless of our efforts on campus to be more intentional in diversity, equity and inclusion, the world outside our doors continues to move in ways which do not necessarily accord with our university’s inclusive values. Nevertheless, as members of the CSUSB community, we state that: As we begin 2024-25, we do not forget that, together, we must continue to strive to be an inclusive community of diverse students and scholars, committed to the positive impact higher education affords our region. Each of us can make a difference. It is fundamental to all we do and desire to achieve here at CSUSB. And now, I am happy to continue a CSUSB tradition and leave you with a video highlighting some of the successes and inspirational achievements of the last year. And don’t forget! Homecoming is right around the corner: Saturday – October 26th!

The steering committee reached a consensus and recommended that the\\xa0Association of Governing Boards (AGB)\\xa0and\\xa0Dr. James Lyons\\xa0be selected to serve CSUSB in this capacity. (Links: https://agb.org/, https://agb.org/james-e-lyons-sr/) The desired goal of the Shared Governance Steering Committee is to work collaboratively with campus stakeholders to develop a statement on shared governance to guide CSUSB forward. Dr. Lyons began his work with CSUSB in Spring 2019, meeting with the various governance groups and to get their impressions of shared governance on campus. Dr. Lyons’ next campus visit will be on October 14 – 15, which will focus on obtaining stakeholder thoughts and guidance on what should be included in the CSUSB Statement on Shared Governance. Dr. Lyons has confirmed a time to meet with each governance group with additional campus forums available. The schedule may be found below. Dr. Lyons will continue his work with CSUSB into Winter Quarter 2020, with the goal of sharing the finalized statement on shared governance at that time. Shared governance is the process by which various constituents (traditionally governing boards, senior administration, and faculty; possibly also staff, students, or others) contribute to decision making related to college or university policy and procedure. When done well, shared governance strengthens the quality of leadership and decision-making at an institution, enhances its ability to achieve its vision and to meet strategic goals, and increases the odds that the very best thinking by all parties to shared governance is brought to bear on institutional challenges. When done well, shared governance engenders an institutional culture of collective ownership and accountability for the institution’s present and future. Further, when faculty, administrators, and boards are actively and collaboratively involved in decision-making processes, decisions are implemented more quickly and more effectively.

It also does not mean that decision-making is always the result of a vote. Importantly, shared governance aims to ensure that no one person is arbitrarily making important decisions absent the input and feedback from key constituents. Source: SDSU Open Conversation about Shared Governance (Links: /sites/default/files/SharedGovernanceDocument_SDSU_Feb2019.pdf) Studies of shared leadership have identified many positive outcomes for teams and organizations that adopt this approach. These include improvements in attitudes and cognition, such as increased satisfaction and trust among team members; improved behavior, such as more constructive interaction and social integration; and improved effectiveness, including in task performance and student learning. New research shows great promise in the use of shared leadership on college campuses. Findings show that shared leadership can create greater cognitive complexity, innovation and peer support in times of challenge and crisis. It can increase accountability within organizations and improve the implementation of organizational decisions.

The program will cover certain content areas in accordance with the guidelines specified by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The program offers two pathways to obtain supplementary authorization in computer science: (1) Specific Authorization and (2) Introductory Authorization. Introductory authorizations added to a Single Subject, Standard Secondary, or Special Secondary (in academic subject areas only) Teaching Credential authorize the holder to teach the supplementary subject matter content typically included in curriculum guidelines and textbooks for study in grades 9 and below. Introductory authorizations added to a Multiple Subject or Standard Elementary Teaching Credential authorize the holder to teach departmentalized classes related to the supplementary authorization listed on their credential in grades 9 and below. Specific authorizations may be added to Single Subject, Standard Secondary and Special Secondary (academic subject areas only) Teaching Credentials and authorize the holder to teach the specific subject in grades preschool, kindergarten-12, and classes organized primarily for adults. Each pathway will require 4 courses to be completed (for a total of 12 units). No prior experience/background in computer science is required. The courses will be taught online.

The CSUSB Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations (OCFR) can identify campus-wide potential partnership opportunities that are in alignment with your vision of giving and corporate social responsibility. Committed to building a stronger community and region, CSUSB invites you to explore a partnership with the university to address your business needs, drive forward positive change and give back to the region. The grant from the Stupski Foundation is in association with the National Academic Advising Association, which, in its awarding of the grant to CSUSB, said, “after reviewing dozens of submissions, your application rose to the top,” in part because of its ability to outline the issues facing the campus and its intentions to address them. The grant is expected to enable the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship to help approximately 250 business owners — a majority of which are owned by Black, indigenous and people of colo— create or sustain about 650 jobs and create an economic impact of nearly $4 million. Grant funds from BIGHORN Cares will be used for monthly produce distribution as well as educational workshops and activities. The first event of Afrolatine California will celebrate the Afro-Oaxacan community of Mexico. It will take place Feb. 25-26 in partnership with the Garcia Center for the Arts in San Bernardino and the Afro-Latinx Connections club at UCLA. The grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation will support an undergraduate digital-mapping program that puts cutting-edge equipment directly in the hands of students. The Nursing Street Medicine program increases access to healthcare by serving the sheltered, unsheltered, and other vulnerable populations in the Coachella Valley through nurse clinics and other outreach programs. Private support plays a vital role in advancing the university’s mission of teaching and service. Partnerships with corporations and foundations ensure that Cal State San Bernardino continues to recruit and train stellar faculty, educate the next generation of leaders and impacts the community through innovation and high quality educational programs.

The CSUSB Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations (OCFR) can identify campus-wide potential partnership opportunities that are in alignment with your vision of giving and corporate social responsibility. Committed to building a stronger community and region, CSUSB invites you to explore a partnership with the university to address your business needs, drive forward positive change and give back to the region. The grant from the Stupski Foundation is in association with the National Academic Advising Association, which, in its awarding of the grant to CSUSB, said, “after reviewing dozens of submissions, your application rose to the top,” in part because of its ability to outline the issues facing the campus and its intentions to address them. The grant is expected to enable the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship to help approximately 250 business owners — a majority of which are owned by Black, indigenous and people of colo— create or sustain about 650 jobs and create an economic impact of nearly $4 million. Grant funds from BIGHORN Cares will be used for monthly produce distribution as well as educational workshops and activities. The first event of Afrolatine California will celebrate the Afro-Oaxacan community of Mexico. It will take place Feb. 25-26 in partnership with the Garcia Center for the Arts in San Bernardino and the Afro-Latinx Connections club at UCLA. The grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation will support an undergraduate digital-mapping program that puts cutting-edge equipment directly in the hands of students. The Nursing Street Medicine program increases access to healthcare by serving the sheltered, unsheltered, and other vulnerable populations in the Coachella Valley through nurse clinics and other outreach programs. Private support plays a vital role in advancing the university’s mission of teaching and service. Partnerships with corporations and foundations ensure that Cal State San Bernardino continues to recruit and train stellar faculty, educate the next generation of leaders and impacts the community through innovation and high quality educational programs.

The \"value added\" by a CSUSB education ranks in the top 4 percent in the nation, according to the Collegiate Learning Assessment, a sequence of tests used by hundreds of colleges and universities nationwide that measure student learning in the freshman and then in the senior year. First-to-second year retention rates are third highest among all CSU campuses. CSUSB reflects the dynamic diversity of the region and has the most diverse student population of any university in the Inland Empire, and it has the second highest African American and Hispanic enrollments of all public universities in California. Seventy percent of those who graduate are the first in their families to do so. The university offers more than 70 traditional baccalaureate and master\\'s degree programs, education credential and certificate programs, and a doctoral program. In recent years, CSUSB added its first doctorate (educational leadership), engineering program (computer science and engineering) and M.F.A. programs in creative writing and studio art/design. Every CSUSB academic program that is eligible has earned national accreditation. The university also is home to the California Professor of the Year (Stuart Sumida). \\xa0 Cal State San Bernardino has seen records in enrollment, diversity of faculty and students, grant and contract funding, overhead funds, fundraising and international programs development. CSUSB ranks as the second-safest among all 33 public universities in California.

The award is given annually to nursing programs that demonstrate excellence in student learning outcomes and program effectiveness, recognizing institutions that use data-driven insights to continually improve nursing education and elevate student success. “It\\'s important for us to find these stories that sometimes make us uncomfortable to be able to see, what can we learn from that today? What can we fix? Because those things are still in our power. Even if this is something that has happened in the past,” said Alicia Gutierrez-Romine ’10, CSUSB professor and renowned expert on the history of abortion in the United States.

I could not be more proud of each and every one of you and the impact you have had and continue to have in transforming the lives of our students, their families and their communities throughout the Inland Empire. Every academic department, student club, musical or theatrical performance, and athletic team contributes in some way to the well-being of the region we serve. This is the very definition of an anchor institution. We are all together here in a very, very special place. We have a vital mission here. And we punch well above our weight. Each one of you is making a real difference. I am delighted to see so many here today as we begin the 2024-25 academic year at Cal State San Bernardino. I would especially like to welcome the many new faces joining our campus, in particular the additions to our faculty, staff and administration. Each of you brings an impressive array of knowledge and experience to our vibrant community. I am glad you are here at CSUSB. I would like to add that I am very proud to welcome 20 new faculty! And welcome to our visiting faculty member—we’re glad you are here! Also, between July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024, we had 283 new employee hires and promotions. We are delighted to have you all as members of CSUSB! We also welcome our undergraduate and graduate students. They range from newcomers getting their initial taste of Coyote life to those entering their final months as they work toward their CSUSB graduation. I would like to begin today by sharing some highlights from our 2023-24 achievements, through the lens of our university’s strategic plan. For Goal 1 – Student Success: For Goal 2 – Faculty and Staff Success: For Goal 3 – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: For Goal 4 – Internationalization: As we think about 2024-25, whose launch we are recognizing today, I now want to take a deep dive into the areas of DEI, civic engagement, enrollment management and student success. They are all deeply woven together and their success, our success, our students’ success, needs to take all these areas into consideration. First, know that, regardless of voices telling us that our nation’s diversity is divisive or a distraction, we are continuing to double down on our DEI focus and efforts here at Cal State San Bernardino. Because, as reporting from the movement advancement project states, “at least 42 states have introduced over 440 bills attacking DEI in a variety of ways, and over half (23) of those states have enacted at least one such law or policy over that time frame.” We are incredibly fortunate to live in a state which is also doubling down on the understanding that our diversity is our strength. In addition, I am thankful we live in a state which values the histories of all Americans and is not afraid to share them, regardless of their darker and painful aspects. Therefore, in this past year we have created the Office of Tribal Relations and the Office of Black Student Success. Because we want to ensure that these members of our student body feel at home and included on our campus.\\xa0 Both offices will be growing their services and offerings in the coming year. We have also just received some terrific news: Excelencia in Education, which is “committed to Ensuring America’s Future by increasing Latino college completion,” has announced that CSUSB’s Upward Bound program is one of 18 finalists in their “2024 Examples of\\xa0Excelencia.” In addition, our “Dream Internship” has made their “Programs to Watch” list! Another key long-term trait and focus of CSUSB is its focus on community and civic engagement. A university has never been, and can never be, treated as some type of ivory tower, divorced from the community in which it sits.\\xa0At CSUSB, we recognize that we are an anchor institution. I say this a lot, to the point where the phrase may begin to sound like it is just words.\\xa0But it is not just words. It is actions. What this means, as a higher education community here in the Inland Empire, in our collective lives as CSUSB and in our personal lives, we support our communities through engagement and involvement. We volunteer. We learn about local issues affecting our city councils and our school boards. And we exercise the franchise, that is, the right we possess as American citizens to vote. Because not only does each vote count (we can see this in local races which can literally be decided by votes that can be counted on the fingers of both hands), but our votes ARE our voices in a democracy. We cannot take anything for granted. We are the ones who build our futures through this valuable tool. We see this on campus as well, with our student elected government, our faculty elected body, and our staff elected body. The next key issue I wish to touch on is enrollment. To be frank, we’re not a university without a student body.\\xa0While we’re not alone in struggling to regain enrollment as a result of the pandemic’s impacts, that doesn’t mean we ignore the current moment. For example, we know we will likely see increased competition for our students from other universities throughout our state. In addition, Institutional Research has recently identified a worrying trend: we are losing more students than we are admitting. For example, in 2023-24, we admitted 4,832 students while 6,123 students either graduated or unfortunately left without earning a degree.\\xa0This means, on average, we admitted 0.8 students for every student who stopped-out or graduated. Everybody has a role—a leadership role—to play in ensuring that students leave here with a degree. That includes encouraging students to attend and then supporting students throughout their academic path so that they persist.\\xa0 So, this is an all hands on deck moment for the entire campus. And I would argue that our alumni also have a role to play as well. Therefore, I would like to briefly recognize our incoming inaugural vice president of the new division of Strategic Enrollment Management and Marketing, Dr. David Dufault-Hunter. He will be joining us at CSUSB on September 3rd from Cal State Northridge. David, we look forward to welcoming you soon! With an increased focus on communications and getting the word out to potential students in our region—about who we are, what we can offer, and how we can help them to realize their academic goals—we can begin to tackle more aggressively both recruitment issues and the loss versus admittance issues we have been facing.\\xa0We must grow enrollment by admitting more students and retaining more students. All of this comes together with our goal to support and promote student success here at CSUSB. We need to look at student success through the lens of an engaged campus. If we want engaged students—we know that engagement promotes persistence and eventual graduation—then we need an engaged campus. And an engaged campus means engaged faculty, staff and administrators. And that is what we are doing at CSUSB. Being physically present, with our students, is key to serving them, and face-to-face interaction is also important for staff interaction. So, effective fall 2024, CSUSB will be moving to a one-day-per-week telecommuting opportunity, maximum, for those whose roles allow remote work. Let 2024-25 be the year of re-engagement with our students so that we can build student success!\\xa0This must be the focus of all who work on this campus, regardless of what position you hold or what area of responsibility you cover. Let’s build one-on-one relationships with our students. Let’s celebrate the way our faculty engage with our students outside the classroom through research projects or through mentoring, student clubs or organizations. Let’s ask ourselves, what are other ways that our college offices and our administrative offices and their employees can engage with our students, including with their clubs and organizations? We cannot remain at a 1,000-foot level. Students are people, not widgets or statistics.\\xa0 Even if your responsibilities do not involve a face-to-face daily interactive role, you are still here to build student success. Again, realizing the potential of our students and realizing the potential of CSUSB are both so tightly woven together that you cannot truly separate one from the other. Therefore, in 2024-25', 'source': 'https://www.csusb.edu/cse'}, {'page_content': 'let us reconnect with this understanding:\\xa0 Let this be the Year of Engagement! I want to conclude today by reminding us all of what it means to be a citizen of Cal State San Bernardino. Regardless of our efforts on campus to be more intentional in diversity, equity and inclusion, the world outside our doors continues to move in ways which do not necessarily accord with our university’s inclusive values. Nevertheless, as members of the CSUSB community, we state that: As we begin 2024-25, we do not forget that, together, we must continue to strive to be an inclusive community of diverse students and scholars, committed to the positive impact higher education affords our region. Each of us can make a difference. It is fundamental to all we do and desire to achieve here at CSUSB. And now, I am happy to continue a CSUSB tradition and leave you with a video highlighting some of the successes and inspirational achievements of the last year. And don’t forget! Homecoming is right around the corner: Saturday – October 26th!

The steering committee reached a consensus and recommended that the\\xa0Association of Governing Boards (AGB)\\xa0and\\xa0Dr. James Lyons\\xa0be selected to serve CSUSB in this capacity. (Links: https://agb.org/, https://agb.org/james-e-lyons-sr/) The desired goal of the Shared Governance Steering Committee is to work collaboratively with campus stakeholders to develop a statement on shared governance to guide CSUSB forward. Dr. Lyons began his work with CSUSB in Spring 2019, meeting with the various governance groups and to get their impressions of shared governance on campus. Dr. Lyons’ next campus visit will be on October 14 – 15, which will focus on obtaining stakeholder thoughts and guidance on what should be included in the CSUSB Statement on Shared Governance. Dr. Lyons has confirmed a time to meet with each governance group with additional campus forums available. The schedule may be found below. Dr. Lyons will continue his work with CSUSB into Winter Quarter 2020, with the goal of sharing the finalized statement on shared governance at that time. Shared governance is the process by which various constituents (traditionally governing boards, senior administration, and faculty; possibly also staff, students, or others) contribute to decision making related to college or university policy and procedure. When done well, shared governance strengthens the quality of leadership and decision-making at an institution, enhances its ability to achieve its vision and to meet strategic goals, and increases the odds that the very best thinking by all parties to shared governance is brought to bear on institutional challenges. When done well, shared governance engenders an institutional culture of collective ownership and accountability for the institution’s present and future. Further, when faculty, administrators, and boards are actively and collaboratively involved in decision-making processes, decisions are implemented more quickly and more effectively.

It also does not mean that decision-making is always the result of a vote. Importantly, shared governance aims to ensure that no one person is arbitrarily making important decisions absent the input and feedback from key constituents. Source: SDSU Open Conversation about Shared Governance (Links: /sites/default/files/SharedGovernanceDocument_SDSU_Feb2019.pdf) Studies of shared leadership have identified many positive outcomes for teams and organizations that adopt this approach. These include improvements in attitudes and cognition, such as increased satisfaction and trust among team members; improved behavior, such as more constructive interaction and social integration; and improved effectiveness, including in task performance and student learning. New research shows great promise in the use of shared leadership on college campuses. Findings show that shared leadership can create greater cognitive complexity, innovation and peer support in times of challenge and crisis. It can increase accountability within organizations and improve the implementation of organizational decisions.

I could not be more proud of each and every one of you and the impact you have had and continue to have in transforming the lives of our students, their families and their communities throughout the Inland Empire. Every academic department, student club, musical or theatrical performance, and athletic team contributes in some way to the well-being of the region we serve. This is the very definition of an anchor institution. We are all together here in a very, very special place. We have a vital mission here. And we punch well above our weight. Each one of you is making a real difference. I am delighted to see so many here today as we begin the 2024-25 academic year at Cal State San Bernardino. I would especially like to welcome the many new faces joining our campus, in particular the additions to our faculty, staff and administration. Each of you brings an impressive array of knowledge and experience to our vibrant community. I am glad you are here at CSUSB. I would like to add that I am very proud to welcome 20 new faculty! And welcome to our visiting faculty member—we’re glad you are here! Also, between July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024, we had 283 new employee hires and promotions. We are delighted to have you all as members of CSUSB! We also welcome our undergraduate and graduate students. They range from newcomers getting their initial taste of Coyote life to those entering their final months as they work toward their CSUSB graduation. I would like to begin today by sharing some highlights from our 2023-24 achievements, through the lens of our university’s strategic plan. For Goal 1 – Student Success: For Goal 2 – Faculty and Staff Success: For Goal 3 – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: For Goal 4 – Internationalization: As we think about 2024-25, whose launch we are recognizing today, I now want to take a deep dive into the areas of DEI, civic engagement, enrollment management and student success. They are all deeply woven together and their success, our success, our students’ success, needs to take all these areas into consideration. First, know that, regardless of voices telling us that our nation’s diversity is divisive or a distraction, we are continuing to double down on our DEI focus and efforts here at Cal State San Bernardino. Because, as reporting from the movement advancement project states, “at least 42 states have introduced over 440 bills attacking DEI in a variety of ways, and over half (23) of those states have enacted at least one such law or policy over that time frame.” We are incredibly fortunate to live in a state which is also doubling down on the understanding that our diversity is our strength. In addition, I am thankful we live in a state which values the histories of all Americans and is not afraid to share them, regardless of their darker and painful aspects. Therefore, in this past year we have created the Office of Tribal Relations and the Office of Black Student Success. Because we want to ensure that these members of our student body feel at home and included on our campus.\\xa0 Both offices will be growing their services and offerings in the coming year. We have also just received some terrific news: Excelencia in Education, which is “committed to Ensuring America’s Future by increasing Latino college completion,” has announced that CSUSB’s Upward Bound program is one of 18 finalists in their “2024 Examples of\\xa0Excelencia.” In addition, our “Dream Internship” has made their “Programs to Watch” list! Another key long-term trait and focus of CSUSB is its focus on community and civic engagement. A university has never been, and can never be, treated as some type of ivory tower, divorced from the community in which it sits.\\xa0At CSUSB, we recognize that we are an anchor institution. I say this a lot, to the point where the phrase may begin to sound like it is just words.\\xa0But it is not just words. It is actions. What this means, as a higher education community here in the Inland Empire, in our collective lives as CSUSB and in our personal lives, we support our communities through engagement and involvement. We volunteer. We learn about local issues affecting our city councils and our school boards. And we exercise the franchise, that is, the right we possess as American citizens to vote. Because not only does each vote count (we can see this in local races which can literally be decided by votes that can be counted on the fingers of both hands), but our votes ARE our voices in a democracy. We cannot take anything for granted. We are the ones who build our futures through this valuable tool. We see this on campus as well, with our student elected government, our faculty elected body, and our staff elected body. The next key issue I wish to touch on is enrollment. To be frank, we’re not a university without a student body.\\xa0While we’re not alone in struggling to regain enrollment as a result of the pandemic’s impacts, that doesn’t mean we ignore the current moment. For example, we know we will likely see increased competition for our students from other universities throughout our state. In addition, Institutional Research has recently identified a worrying trend: we are losing more students than we are admitting. For example, in 2023-24, we admitted 4,832 students while 6,123 students either graduated or unfortunately left without earning a degree.\\xa0This means, on average, we admitted 0.8 students for every student who stopped-out or graduated. Everybody has a role—a leadership role—to play in ensuring that students leave here with a degree. That includes encouraging students to attend and then supporting students throughout their academic path so that they persist.\\xa0 So, this is an all hands on deck moment for the entire campus. And I would argue that our alumni also have a role to play as well. Therefore, I would like to briefly recognize our incoming inaugural vice president of the new division of Strategic Enrollment Management and Marketing, Dr. David Dufault-Hunter. He will be joining us at CSUSB on September 3rd from Cal State Northridge. David, we look forward to welcoming you soon! With an increased focus on communications and getting the word out to potential students in our region—about who we are, what we can offer, and how we can help them to realize their academic goals—we can begin to tackle more aggressively both recruitment issues and the loss versus admittance issues we have been facing.\\xa0We must grow enrollment by admitting more students and retaining more students. All of this comes together with our goal to support and promote student success here at CSUSB. We need to look at student success through the lens of an engaged campus. If we want engaged students—we know that engagement promotes persistence and eventual graduation—then we need an engaged campus. And an engaged campus means engaged faculty, staff and administrators. And that is what we are doing at CSUSB. Being physically present, with our students, is key to serving them, and face-to-face interaction is also important for staff interaction. So, effective fall 2024', 'source': 'https://www.csusb.edu/cse'}, {'page_content': 'CSUSB will be moving to a one-day-per-week telecommuting opportunity, maximum, for those whose roles allow remote work. Let 2024-25 be the year of re-engagement with our students so that we can build student success!\\xa0This must be the focus of all who work on this campus, regardless of what position you hold or what area of responsibility you cover. Let’s build one-on-one relationships with our students. Let’s celebrate the way our faculty engage with our students outside the classroom through research projects or through mentoring, student clubs or organizations. Let’s ask ourselves, what are other ways that our college offices and our administrative offices and their employees can engage with our students, including with their clubs and organizations? We cannot remain at a 1,000-foot level. Students are people, not widgets or statistics.\\xa0 Even if your responsibilities do not involve a face-to-face daily interactive role, you are still here to build student success. Again, realizing the potential of our students and realizing the potential of CSUSB are both so tightly woven together that you cannot truly separate one from the other. Therefore, in 2024-25, let us reconnect with this understanding:\\xa0 Let this be the Year of Engagement! I want to conclude today by reminding us all of what it means to be a citizen of Cal State San Bernardino. Regardless of our efforts on campus to be more intentional in diversity, equity and inclusion, the world outside our doors continues to move in ways which do not necessarily accord with our university’s inclusive values. Nevertheless, as members of the CSUSB community, we state that: As we begin 2024-25, we do not forget that, together, we must continue to strive to be an inclusive community of diverse students and scholars, committed to the positive impact higher education affords our region. Each of us can make a difference. It is fundamental to all we do and desire to achieve here at CSUSB. And now, I am happy to continue a CSUSB tradition and leave you with a video highlighting some of the successes and inspirational achievements of the last year. And don’t forget! Homecoming is right around the corner: Saturday – October 26th!

The steering committee reached a consensus and recommended that the\\xa0Association of Governing Boards (AGB)\\xa0and\\xa0Dr. James Lyons\\xa0be selected to serve CSUSB in this capacity. (Links: https://agb.org/, https://agb.org/james-e-lyons-sr/) The desired goal of the Shared Governance Steering Committee is to work collaboratively with campus stakeholders to develop a statement on shared governance to guide CSUSB forward. Dr. Lyons began his work with CSUSB in Spring 2019, meeting with the various governance groups and to get their impressions of shared governance on campus. Dr. Lyons’ next campus visit will be on October 14 – 15, which will focus on obtaining stakeholder thoughts and guidance on what should be included in the CSUSB Statement on Shared Governance. Dr. Lyons has confirmed a time to meet with each governance group with additional campus forums available. The schedule may be found below. Dr. Lyons will continue his work with CSUSB into Winter Quarter 2020, with the goal of sharing the finalized statement on shared governance at that time. Shared governance is the process by which various constituents (traditionally governing boards, senior administration, and faculty; possibly also staff, students, or others) contribute to decision making related to college or university policy and procedure. When done well, shared governance strengthens the quality of leadership and decision-making at an institution, enhances its ability to achieve its vision and to meet strategic goals, and increases the odds that the very best thinking by all parties to shared governance is brought to bear on institutional challenges. When done well, shared governance engenders an institutional culture of collective ownership and accountability for the institution’s present and future. Further, when faculty, administrators, and boards are actively and collaboratively involved in decision-making processes, decisions are implemented more quickly and more effectively.

It also does not mean that decision-making is always the result of a vote. Importantly, shared governance aims to ensure that no one person is arbitrarily making important decisions absent the input and feedback from key constituents. Source: SDSU Open Conversation about Shared Governance (Links: /sites/default/files/SharedGovernanceDocument_SDSU_Feb2019.pdf) Studies of shared leadership have identified many positive outcomes for teams and organizations that adopt this approach. These include improvements in attitudes and cognition, such as increased satisfaction and trust among team members; improved behavior, such as more constructive interaction and social integration; and improved effectiveness, including in task performance and student learning. New research shows great promise in the use of shared leadership on college campuses. Findings show that shared leadership can create greater cognitive complexity, innovation and peer support in times of challenge and crisis. It can increase accountability within organizations and improve the implementation of organizational decisions.

The program will cover certain content areas in accordance with the guidelines specified by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The program offers two pathways to obtain supplementary authorization in computer science: (1) Specific Authorization and (2) Introductory Authorization. Introductory authorizations added to a Single Subject, Standard Secondary, or Special Secondary (in academic subject areas only) Teaching Credential authorize the holder to teach the supplementary subject matter content typically included in curriculum guidelines and textbooks for study in grades 9 and below. Introductory authorizations added to a Multiple Subject or Standard Elementary Teaching Credential authorize the holder to teach departmentalized classes related to the supplementary authorization listed on their credential in grades 9 and below. Specific authorizations may be added to Single Subject, Standard Secondary and Special Secondary (academic subject areas only) Teaching Credentials and authorize the holder to teach the specific subject in grades preschool, kindergarten-12, and classes organized primarily for adults. Each pathway will require 4 courses to be completed (for a total of 12 units). No prior experience/background in computer science is required. The courses will be taught online.

The CSUSB Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations (OCFR) can identify campus-wide potential partnership opportunities that are in alignment with your vision of giving and corporate social responsibility. Committed to building a stronger community and region, CSUSB invites you to explore a partnership with the university to address your business needs, drive forward positive change and give back to the region. The grant from the Stupski Foundation is in association with the National Academic Advising Association, which, in its awarding of the grant to CSUSB, said, “after reviewing dozens of submissions, your application rose to the top,” in part because of its ability to outline the issues facing the campus and its intentions to address them. The grant is expected to enable the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship to help approximately 250 business owners — a majority of which are owned by Black, indigenous and people of colo— create or sustain about 650 jobs and create an economic impact of nearly $4 million. Grant funds from BIGHORN Cares will be used for monthly produce distribution as well as educational workshops and activities. The first event of Afrolatine California will celebrate the Afro-Oaxacan community of Mexico. It will take place Feb. 25-26 in partnership with the Garcia Center for the Arts in San Bernardino and the Afro-Latinx Connections club at UCLA. The grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation will support an undergraduate digital-mapping program that puts cutting-edge equipment directly in the hands of students. The Nursing Street Medicine program increases access to healthcare by serving the sheltered, unsheltered, and other vulnerable populations in the Coachella Valley through nurse clinics and other outreach programs. Private support plays a vital role in advancing the university’s mission of teaching and service. Partnerships with corporations and foundations ensure that Cal State San Bernardino continues to recruit and train stellar faculty, educate the next generation of leaders and impacts the community through innovation and high quality educational programs.

The CSUSB Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations (OCFR) can identify campus-wide potential partnership opportunities that are in alignment with your vision of giving and corporate social responsibility. Committed to building a stronger community and region, CSUSB invites you to explore a partnership with the university to address your business needs, drive forward positive change and give back to the region. The grant from the Stupski Foundation is in association with the National Academic Advising Association, which, in its awarding of the grant to CSUSB, said, “after reviewing dozens of submissions, your application rose to the top,” in part because of its ability to outline the issues facing the campus and its intentions to address them. The grant is expected to enable the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship to help approximately 250 business owners — a majority of which are owned by Black, indigenous and people of colo— create or sustain about 650 jobs and create an economic impact of nearly $4 million. Grant funds from BIGHORN Cares will be used for monthly produce distribution as well as educational workshops and activities. The first event of Afrolatine California will celebrate the Afro-Oaxacan community of Mexico. It will take place Feb. 25-26 in partnership with the Garcia Center for the Arts in San Bernardino and the Afro-Latinx Connections club at UCLA. The grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation will support an undergraduate digital-mapping program that puts cutting-edge equipment directly in the hands of students. The Nursing Street Medicine program increases access to healthcare by serving the sheltered, unsheltered, and other vulnerable populations in the Coachella Valley through nurse clinics and other outreach programs. Private support plays a vital role in advancing the university’s mission of teaching and service. Partnerships with corporations and foundations ensure that Cal State San Bernardino continues to recruit and train stellar faculty, educate the next generation of leaders and impacts the community through innovation and high quality educational programs.

Opened in 1965 and set at the foothills of the beautiful San Bernardino Mountains, the university serves more than 20,000 students each year and graduates about 4,000 students annually.  The \"value added\" by a CSUSB education ranks in the top 4 percent in the nation, according to the Collegiate Learning Assessment, a sequence of tests used by hundreds of colleges and universities nationwide that measure student learning in the freshman and then in the senior year. First-to-second year retention rates are third highest among all CSU campuses. CSUSB reflects the dynamic diversity of the region and has the most diverse student population of any university in the Inland Empire, and it has the second highest African American and Hispanic enrollments of all public universities in California. Seventy percent of those who graduate are the first in their families to do so. The university offers more than 70 traditional baccalaureate and master\\'s degree programs, education credential and certificate programs, and a doctoral program. In recent years, CSUSB added its first doctorate (educational leadership), engineering program (computer science and engineering) and M.F.A. programs in creative writing and studio art/design. Every CSUSB academic program that is eligible has earned national accreditation. The university also is home to the California Professor of the Year (Stuart Sumida). \\xa0 Cal State San Bernardino has seen records in enrollment, diversity of faculty and students, grant and contract funding, overhead funds, fundraising and international programs development. CSUSB ranks as the second-safest among all 33 public universities in California. Cal State San Bernardino is listed among the best colleges and universities in the western United States, according to The Princeton Review, Forbes and U.S. News and World Report, in their respective annual rankings. It also is part of the President\\'s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, With Distinction – the highest federal recognition a college or university can receive for its commitment to service-learning and civic engagement. In addition, it is a \"Military Friendly School\" according to G.I. Jobs. CSUSB\\'s College of Business and Public Administration was named by European CEO Magazine as one of the four most innovative business schools in the U.S. and among the top 18 in the world.

The grant will fund the creation of a new certificate program designed to help students become proficient in Spanish while gaining valuable business and administration skills.  CSUSB’s Department of Nursing was one of three programs in the nation honored with the 2024 Benchworks Assessment and Impact Award in Nursing Education. The award is given annually to nursing programs that demonstrate excellence in student learning outcomes and program effectiveness, recognizing institutions that use data-driven insights to continually improve nursing education and elevate student success. “It\\'s important for us to find these stories that sometimes make us uncomfortable to be able to see, what can we learn from that today? What can we fix? Because those things are still in our power. Even if this is something that has happened in the past,” said Alicia Gutierrez-Romine ’10, CSUSB professor and renowned expert on the history of abortion in the United States.

I could not be more proud of each and every one of you and the impact you have had and continue to have in transforming the lives of our students, their families and their communities throughout the Inland Empire. Every academic department, student club, musical or theatrical performance, and athletic team contributes in some way to the well-being of the region we serve. This is the very definition of an anchor institution. We are all together here in a very, very special place. We have a vital mission here. And we punch well above our weight. Each one of you is making a real difference. I am delighted to see so many here today as we begin the 2024-25 academic year at Cal State San Bernardino. I would especially like to welcome the many new faces joining our campus, in particular the additions to our faculty, staff and administration. Each of you brings an impressive array of knowledge and experience to our vibrant community. I am glad you are here at CSUSB. I would like to add that I am very proud to welcome 20 new faculty! And welcome to our visiting faculty member—we’re glad you are here! Also, between July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024, we had 283 new employee hires and promotions. We are delighted to have you all as members of CSUSB! We also welcome our undergraduate and graduate students. They range from newcomers getting their initial taste of Coyote life to those entering their final months as they work toward their CSUSB graduation. I would like to begin today by sharing some highlights from our 2023-24 achievements, through the lens of our university’s strategic plan. For Goal 1 – Student Success: For Goal 2 – Faculty and Staff Success: For Goal 3 – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: For Goal 4 – Internationalization: As we think about 2024-25, whose launch we are recognizing today, I now want to take a deep dive into the areas of DEI, civic engagement, enrollment management and student success. They are all deeply woven together and their success, our success, our students’ success, needs to take all these areas into consideration. First, know that, regardless of voices telling us that our nation’s diversity is divisive or a distraction, we are continuing to double down on our DEI focus and efforts here at Cal State San Bernardino. Because, as reporting from the movement advancement project states, “at least 42 states have introduced over 440 bills attacking DEI in a variety of ways, and over half (23) of those states have enacted at least one such law or policy over that time frame.” We are incredibly fortunate to live in a state which is also doubling down on the understanding that our diversity is our strength. In addition, I am thankful we live in a state which values the histories of all Americans and is not afraid to share them, regardless of their darker and painful aspects. Therefore, in this past year we have created the Office of Tribal Relations and the Office of Black Student Success. Because we want to ensure that these members of our student body feel at home and included on our campus.\\xa0 Both offices will be growing their services and offerings in the coming year. We have also just received some terrific news: Excelencia in Education, which is “committed to Ensuring America’s Future by increasing Latino college completion,” has announced that CSUSB’s Upward Bound program is one of 18 finalists in their “2024 Examples of\\xa0Excelencia.” In addition, our “Dream Internship” has made their “Programs to Watch” list! Another key long-term trait and focus of CSUSB is its focus on community and civic engagement. A university has never been, and can never be, treated as some type of ivory tower, divorced from the community in which it sits.\\xa0At CSUSB, we recognize that we are an anchor institution. I say this a lot, to the point where the phrase may begin to sound like it is just words.\\xa0But it is not just words. It is actions. What this means, as a higher education community here in the Inland Empire, in our collective lives as CSUSB and in our personal lives, we support our communities through engagement and involvement. We volunteer. We learn about local issues affecting our city councils and our school boards. And we exercise the franchise, that is, the right we possess as American citizens to vote. Because not only does each vote count (we can see this in local races which can literally be decided by votes that can be counted on the fingers of both hands), but our votes ARE our voices in a democracy. We cannot take anything for granted. We are the ones who build our futures through this valuable tool. We see this on campus as well, with our student elected government, our faculty elected body, and our staff elected body. The next key issue I wish to touch on is enrollment. To be frank, we’re not a university without a student body.\\xa0While we’re not alone in struggling to regain enrollment as a result of the pandemic’s impacts, that doesn’t mean we ignore the current moment. For example, we know we will likely see increased competition for our students from other universities throughout our state. In addition, Institutional Research has recently identified a worrying trend: we are losing more students than we are admitting. For example, in 2023-24, we admitted 4,832 students while 6,123 students either graduated or unfortunately left without earning a degree.\\xa0This means, on average, we admitted 0.8 students for every student who stopped-out or graduated. Everybody has a role—a leadership role—to play in ensuring that students leave here with a degree. That includes encouraging students to attend and then supporting students throughout their academic path so that they persist.\\xa0 So, this is an all hands on deck moment for the entire campus. And I would argue that our alumni also have a role to play as well. Therefore, I would like to briefly recognize our incoming inaugural vice president of the new division of Strategic Enrollment Management and Marketing, Dr. David Dufault-Hunter. He will be joining us at CSUSB on September 3rd from Cal State Northridge. David, we look forward to welcoming you soon! With an increased focus on communications and getting the word out to potential students in our region—about who we are, what we can offer, and how we can help them to realize their academic goals—we can begin to tackle more aggressively both recruitment issues and the loss versus admittance issues we have been facing.\\xa0We must grow enrollment by admitting more students and retaining more students. All of this comes together with our goal to support and promote student success here at CSUSB. We need to look at student success through the lens of an engaged campus. If we want engaged students—we know that engagement promotes persistence and eventual graduation—then we need an engaged campus. And an engaged campus means engaged faculty, staff and administrators. And that is what we are doing at CSUSB. Being physically present, with our students, is key to serving them, and face-to-face interaction is also important for staff interaction. So, effective fall 2024, CSUSB will be moving to a one-day-per-week telecommuting opportunity, maximum, for those whose roles allow remote work. Let 2024-25 be the year of re-engagement with our students so that we can build student success!\\xa0This must be the focus of all who work on this campus, regardless of what position you hold or what area of responsibility you cover. Let’s build one-on-one relationships with our students. Let’s celebrate the way our faculty engage with our students outside the classroom through research projects or through mentoring, student clubs or organizations. Let’s ask ourselves, what are other ways that our college offices and our administrative offices and their employees can engage with our students, including with their clubs and organizations? We cannot remain at a 1,000-foot level. Students are people, not widgets or statistics.\\xa0 Even if your responsibilities do not involve a face-to-face daily interactive role, you are still here to build student success. Again, realizing the potential of our students and realizing the potential of CSUSB are both so tightly woven together that you cannot truly separate one from the other. Therefore, in 2024-25', 'source': 'https://www.csusb.edu/cse'}, {'page_content': 'let us reconnect with this understanding:\\xa0 Let this be the Year of Engagement! I want to conclude today by reminding us all of what it means to be a citizen of Cal State San Bernardino. Regardless of our efforts on campus to be more intentional in diversity, equity and inclusion, the world outside our doors continues to move in ways which do not necessarily accord with our university’s inclusive values. Nevertheless, as members of the CSUSB community, we state that: As we begin 2024-25, we do not forget that, together, we must continue to strive to be an inclusive community of diverse students and scholars, committed to the positive impact higher education affords our region. Each of us can make a difference. It is fundamental to all we do and desire to achieve here at CSUSB. And now, I am happy to continue a CSUSB tradition and leave you with a video highlighting some of the successes and inspirational achievements of the last year. And don’t forget! Homecoming is right around the corner: Saturday – October 26th!

(Links: https://agb.org/, https://agb.org/james-e-lyons-sr/) The desired goal of the Shared Governance Steering Committee is to work collaboratively with campus stakeholders to develop a statement on shared governance to guide CSUSB forward. Dr. Lyons began his work with CSUSB in Spring 2019, meeting with the various governance groups and to get their impressions of shared governance on campus. Dr. Lyons’ next campus visit will be on October 14 – 15, which will focus on obtaining stakeholder thoughts and guidance on what should be included in the CSUSB Statement on Shared Governance. Dr. Lyons has confirmed a time to meet with each governance group with additional campus forums available. The schedule may be found below. Dr. Lyons will continue his work with CSUSB into Winter Quarter 2020, with the goal of sharing the finalized statement on shared governance at that time. Shared governance is the process by which various constituents (traditionally governing boards, senior administration, and faculty; possibly also staff, students, or others) contribute to decision making related to college or university policy and procedure. When done well, shared governance strengthens the quality of leadership and decision-making at an institution, enhances its ability to achieve its vision and to meet strategic goals, and increases the odds that the very best thinking by all parties to shared governance is brought to bear on institutional challenges. When done well, shared governance engenders an institutional culture of collective ownership and accountability for the institution’s present and future. Further, when faculty, administrators, and boards are actively and collaboratively involved in decision-making processes, decisions are implemented more quickly and more effectively.

It also does not mean that decision-making is always the result of a vote. Importantly, shared governance aims to ensure that no one person is arbitrarily making important decisions absent the input and feedback from key constituents. Source: SDSU Open Conversation about Shared Governance (Links: /sites/default/files/SharedGovernanceDocument_SDSU_Feb2019.pdf) Studies of shared leadership have identified many positive outcomes for teams and organizations that adopt this approach. These include improvements in attitudes and cognition, such as increased satisfaction and trust among team members; improved behavior, such as more constructive interaction and social integration; and improved effectiveness, including in task performance and student learning. New research shows great promise in the use of shared leadership on college campuses. Findings show that shared leadership can create greater cognitive complexity, innovation and peer support in times of challenge and crisis. It can increase accountability within organizations and improve the implementation of organizational decisions.

I could not be more proud of each and every one of you and the impact you have had and continue to have in transforming the lives of our students, their families and their communities throughout the Inland Empire. Every academic department, student club, musical or theatrical performance, and athletic team contributes in some way to the well-being of the region we serve. This is the very definition of an anchor institution. We are all together here in a very, very special place. We have a vital mission here. And we punch well above our weight. Each one of you is making a real difference. I am delighted to see so many here today as we begin the 2024-25 academic year at Cal State San Bernardino. I would especially like to welcome the many new faces joining our campus, in particular the additions to our faculty, staff and administration. Each of you brings an impressive array of knowledge and experience to our vibrant community. I am glad you are here at CSUSB. I would like to add that I am very proud to welcome 20 new faculty! And welcome to our visiting faculty member—we’re glad you are here! Also, between July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024, we had 283 new employee hires and promotions. We are delighted to have you all as members of CSUSB! We also welcome our undergraduate and graduate students. They range from newcomers getting their initial taste of Coyote life to those entering their final months as they work toward their CSUSB graduation. I would like to begin today by sharing some highlights from our 2023-24 achievements, through the lens of our university’s strategic plan. For Goal 1 – Student Success: For Goal 2 – Faculty and Staff Success: For Goal 3 – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: For Goal 4 – Internationalization: As we think about 2024-25, whose launch we are recognizing today, I now want to take a deep dive into the areas of DEI, civic engagement, enrollment management and student success. They are all deeply woven together and their success, our success, our students’ success, needs to take all these areas into consideration. First, know that, regardless of voices telling us that our nation’s diversity is divisive or a distraction, we are continuing to double down on our DEI focus and efforts here at Cal State San Bernardino. Because, as reporting from the movement advancement project states, “at least 42 states have introduced over 440 bills attacking DEI in a variety of ways, and over half (23) of those states have enacted at least one such law or policy over that time frame.” We are incredibly fortunate to live in a state which is also doubling down on the understanding that our diversity is our strength. In addition, I am thankful we live in a state which values the histories of all Americans and is not afraid to share them, regardless of their darker and painful aspects. Therefore, in this past year we have created the Office of Tribal Relations and the Office of Black Student Success. Because we want to ensure that these members of our student body feel at home and included on our campus.\\xa0 Both offices will be growing their services and offerings in the coming year. We have also just received some terrific news: Excelencia in Education, which is “committed to Ensuring America’s Future by increasing Latino college completion,” has announced that CSUSB’s Upward Bound program is one of 18 finalists in their “2024 Examples of\\xa0Excelencia.” In addition, our “Dream Internship” has made their “Programs to Watch” list! Another key long-term trait and focus of CSUSB is its focus on community and civic engagement. A university has never been, and can never be, treated as some type of ivory tower, divorced from the community in which it sits.\\xa0At CSUSB, we recognize that we are an anchor institution. I say this a lot, to the point where the phrase may begin to sound like it is just words.\\xa0But it is not just words. It is actions. What this means, as a higher education community here in the Inland Empire, in our collective lives as CSUSB and in our personal lives, we support our communities through engagement and involvement. We volunteer. We learn about local issues affecting our city councils and our school boards. And we exercise the franchise, that is, the right we possess as American citizens to vote. Because not only does each vote count (we can see this in local races which can literally be decided by votes that can be counted on the fingers of both hands), but our votes ARE our voices in a democracy. We cannot take anything for granted. We are the ones who build our futures through this valuable tool. We see this on campus as well, with our student elected government, our faculty elected body, and our staff elected body. The next key issue I wish to touch on is enrollment. To be frank, we’re not a university without a student body.\\xa0While we’re not alone in struggling to regain enrollment as a result of the pandemic’s impacts, that doesn’t mean we ignore the current moment. For example, we know we will likely see increased competition for our students from other universities throughout our state. In addition, Institutional Research has recently identified a worrying trend: we are losing more students than we are admitting. For example, in 2023-24, we admitted 4,832 students while 6,123 students either graduated or unfortunately left without earning a degree.\\xa0This means, on average, we admitted 0.8 students for every student who stopped-out or graduated. Everybody has a role—a leadership role—to play in ensuring that students leave here with a degree. That includes encouraging students to attend and then supporting students throughout their academic path so that they persist.\\xa0 So, this is an all hands on deck moment for the entire campus. And I would argue that our alumni also have a role to play as well. Therefore, I would like to briefly recognize our incoming inaugural vice president of the new division of Strategic Enrollment Management and Marketing, Dr. David Dufault-Hunter. He will be joining us at CSUSB on September 3rd from Cal State Northridge. David, we look forward to welcoming you soon! With an increased focus on communications and getting the word out to potential students in our region—about who we are, what we can offer, and how we can help them to realize their academic goals—we can begin to tackle more aggressively both recruitment issues and the loss versus admittance issues we have been facing.\\xa0We must grow enrollment by admitting more students and retaining more students. All of this comes together with our goal to support and promote student success here at CSUSB. We need to look at student success through the lens of an engaged campus. If we want engaged students—we know that engagement promotes persistence and eventual graduation—then we need an engaged campus. And an engaged campus means engaged faculty, staff and administrators. And that is what we are doing at CSUSB. Being physically present, with our students, is key to serving them, and face-to-face interaction is also important for staff interaction. So, effective fall 2024', 'source': 'https://www.csusb.edu/cse'}, {'page_content': 'CSUSB will be moving to a one-day-per-week telecommuting opportunity, maximum, for those whose roles allow remote work. Let 2024-25 be the year of re-engagement with our students so that we can build student success!\\xa0This must be the focus of all who work on this campus, regardless of what position you hold or what area of responsibility you cover. Let’s build one-on-one relationships with our students. Let’s celebrate the way our faculty engage with our students outside the classroom through research projects or through mentoring, student clubs or organizations. Let’s ask ourselves, what are other ways that our college offices and our administrative offices and their employees can engage with our students, including with their clubs and organizations? We cannot remain at a 1,000-foot level. Students are people, not widgets or statistics.\\xa0 Even if your responsibilities do not involve a face-to-face daily interactive role, you are still here to build student success. Again, realizing the potential of our students and realizing the potential of CSUSB are both so tightly woven together that you cannot truly separate one from the other. Therefore, in 2024-25, let us reconnect with this understanding:\\xa0 Let this be the Year of Engagement! I want to conclude today by reminding us all of what it means to be a citizen of Cal State San Bernardino. Regardless of our efforts on campus to be more intentional in diversity, equity and inclusion, the world outside our doors continues to move in ways which do not necessarily accord with our university’s inclusive values. Nevertheless, as members of the CSUSB community, we state that: As we begin 2024-25, we do not forget that, together, we must continue to strive to be an inclusive community of diverse students and scholars, committed to the positive impact higher education affords our region. Each of us can make a difference. It is fundamental to all we do and desire to achieve here at CSUSB. And now, I am happy to continue a CSUSB tradition and leave you with a video highlighting some of the successes and inspirational achievements of the last year. And don’t forget! Homecoming is right around the corner: Saturday – October 26th!

The steering committee reached a consensus and recommended that the\\xa0Association of Governing Boards (AGB)\\xa0and\\xa0Dr. James Lyons\\xa0be selected to serve CSUSB in this capacity. (Links: https://agb.org/, https://agb.org/james-e-lyons-sr/) The desired goal of the Shared Governance Steering Committee is to work collaboratively with campus stakeholders to develop a statement on shared governance to guide CSUSB forward. Dr. Lyons began his work with CSUSB in Spring 2019, meeting with the various governance groups and to get their impressions of shared governance on campus. Dr. Lyons’ next campus visit will be on October 14 – 15, which will focus on obtaining stakeholder thoughts and guidance on what should be included in the CSUSB Statement on Shared Governance. Dr. Lyons has confirmed a time to meet with each governance group with additional campus forums available. The schedule may be found below. Dr. Lyons will continue his work with CSUSB into Winter Quarter 2020, with the goal of sharing the finalized statement on shared governance at that time. Shared governance is the process by which various constituents (traditionally governing boards, senior administration, and faculty; possibly also staff, students, or others) contribute to decision making related to college or university policy and procedure. When done well, shared governance strengthens the quality of leadership and decision-making at an institution, enhances its ability to achieve its vision and to meet strategic goals, and increases the odds that the very best thinking by all parties to shared governance is brought to bear on institutional challenges. When done well, shared governance engenders an institutional culture of collective ownership and accountability for the institution’s present and future. Further, when faculty, administrators, and boards are actively and collaboratively involved in decision-making processes, decisions are implemented more quickly and more effectively.

It also does not mean that decision-making is always the result of a vote. Importantly, shared governance aims to ensure that no one person is arbitrarily making important decisions absent the input and feedback from key constituents. Source: SDSU Open Conversation about Shared Governance (Links: /sites/default/files/SharedGovernanceDocument_SDSU_Feb2019.pdf) Studies of shared leadership have identified many positive outcomes for teams and organizations that adopt this approach. These include improvements in attitudes and cognition, such as increased satisfaction and trust among team members; improved behavior, such as more constructive interaction and social integration; and improved effectiveness, including in task performance and student learning. New research shows great promise in the use of shared leadership on college campuses. Findings show that shared leadership can create greater cognitive complexity, innovation and peer support in times of challenge and crisis. It can increase accountability within organizations and improve the implementation of organizational decisions.

The program will cover certain content areas in accordance with the guidelines specified by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC). The program offers two pathways to obtain supplementary authorization in computer science: (1) Specific Authorization and (2) Introductory Authorization. Introductory authorizations added to a Single Subject, Standard Secondary, or Special Secondary (in academic subject areas only) Teaching Credential authorize the holder to teach the supplementary subject matter content typically included in curriculum guidelines and textbooks for study in grades 9 and below. Introductory authorizations added to a Multiple Subject or Standard Elementary Teaching Credential authorize the holder to teach departmentalized classes related to the supplementary authorization listed on their credential in grades 9 and below. Specific authorizations may be added to Single Subject, Standard Secondary and Special Secondary (academic subject areas only) Teaching Credentials and authorize the holder to teach the specific subject in grades preschool, kindergarten-12, and classes organized primarily for adults. Each pathway will require 4 courses to be completed (for a total of 12 units). No prior experience/background in computer science is required. The courses will be taught online.

The CSUSB Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations (OCFR) can identify campus-wide potential partnership opportunities that are in alignment with your vision of giving and corporate social responsibility. Committed to building a stronger community and region, CSUSB invites you to explore a partnership with the university to address your business needs, drive forward positive change and give back to the region. The grant from the Stupski Foundation is in association with the National Academic Advising Association, which, in its awarding of the grant to CSUSB, said, “after reviewing dozens of submissions, your application rose to the top,” in part because of its ability to outline the issues facing the campus and its intentions to address them. The grant is expected to enable the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship to help approximately 250 business owners — a majority of which are owned by Black, indigenous and people of colo— create or sustain about 650 jobs and create an economic impact of nearly $4 million. Grant funds from BIGHORN Cares will be used for monthly produce distribution as well as educational workshops and activities. The first event of Afrolatine California will celebrate the Afro-Oaxacan community of Mexico. It will take place Feb. 25-26 in partnership with the Garcia Center for the Arts in San Bernardino and the Afro-Latinx Connections club at UCLA. The grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation will support an undergraduate digital-mapping program that puts cutting-edge equipment directly in the hands of students. The Nursing Street Medicine program increases access to healthcare by serving the sheltered, unsheltered, and other vulnerable populations in the Coachella Valley through nurse clinics and other outreach programs. Private support plays a vital role in advancing the university’s mission of teaching and service. Partnerships with corporations and foundations ensure that Cal State San Bernardino continues to recruit and train stellar faculty, educate the next generation of leaders and impacts the community through innovation and high quality educational programs.

The CSUSB Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations (OCFR) can identify campus-wide potential partnership opportunities that are in alignment with your vision of giving and corporate social responsibility. Committed to building a stronger community and region, CSUSB invites you to explore a partnership with the university to address your business needs, drive forward positive change and give back to the region. The grant from the Stupski Foundation is in association with the National Academic Advising Association, which, in its awarding of the grant to CSUSB, said, “after reviewing dozens of submissions, your application rose to the top,” in part because of its ability to outline the issues facing the campus and its intentions to address them. The grant is expected to enable the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship to help approximately 250 business owners — a majority of which are owned by Black, indigenous and people of colo— create or sustain about 650 jobs and create an economic impact of nearly $4 million. Grant funds from BIGHORN Cares will be used for monthly produce distribution as well as educational workshops and activities. The first event of Afrolatine California will celebrate the Afro-Oaxacan community of Mexico. It will take place Feb. 25-26 in partnership with the Garcia Center for the Arts in San Bernardino and the Afro-Latinx Connections club at UCLA. The grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation will support an undergraduate digital-mapping program that puts cutting-edge equipment directly in the hands of students. The Nursing Street Medicine program increases access to healthcare by serving the sheltered, unsheltered, and other vulnerable populations in the Coachella Valley through nurse clinics and other outreach programs. Private support plays a vital role in advancing the university’s mission of teaching and service. Partnerships with corporations and foundations ensure that Cal State San Bernardino continues to recruit and train stellar faculty, educate the next generation of leaders and impacts the community through innovation and high quality educational programs.
